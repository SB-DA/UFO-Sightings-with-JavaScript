# UFO Sightings with JavaScript
Applied JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

## Overview
Dana is a Data Journalist and she had the opportunity to write about her hometown Mc. Minnville, Oregon which is famous for UFO sightings. For this assignment, we had to go through javaScript filled to the brim with sightings information. We planned to first use javascript to display the data as a table. However, because there was so much data to sift through without any adjustments it was a challenge. It was a little tricky to add more than one filter but we took up the challenge.
Additionally, when we updated the data, we wanted to put everything together in a tidy HTML page so we can fine tune the results to support the article and find required data.

## Challenge Overview
Danaâ€™s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she wanted to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, We added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### Link to the Webpage

Below the information has been filtered by city. Similarly we can filter it by State and Country or even Shape.

## Summary
- The webpage and dynamic table is working as intended but I feel user's might find it confusing which parameter to put and search for details.
- Adding a filter button and clear search criteria option will also be helpful.
